#summary Describes how to annotate fields with referenced objects.

= Referencing Objects =

Mongo references are references from one document (object) to another within the database. Consider the following classes:

{{{
public class BlogEntry {

    private String title;
    private Date publishDate;
    private String body;

    private Author author;

    // getters and setters
}

...

public class Author {

    private String username;
    private String fullName;
    private String emailAddress;

    // getters and setters
}
}}}

The question here is: _How do we annotate the author field in BlogEntry?_ We could of course use the @Embedded annotation, but that does not make sense here, since we don't want to store the Author with every BlogEntry instance. Instead we want multiple blog entries to reference a single Author document in Mongo.

For this case we use the @Reference annotation:

{{{
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.CollectionName;
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Entity;
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Embedded;
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Id;
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Reference;
import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Property;

@Entity
public class BlogEntry {

    @Id
    private String id;
    @CollectionName
    private String collectionName;

    private String title;
    private Date publishDate;
    private String body;

    @Reference
    private Author author;

    // getters and setters
}

...

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private String id;
    @CollectionName
    private String collectionName;

    private String username;
    private String fullName;
    private String emailAddress;

    // getters and setters
}
}}}

One very important thing to mention when working with references: _The referenced object must have been saved in Mongo before saving the object referencing it._

This makes sense, really. In terms of the example above, it means that you must already have an Author in the database before you can create a BlogEntry.

By default, Morphia uses the field name as the value name in Mongo. This can be overridden by specifying a name on the @Reference annotation:

{{{
    @Reference(name = "blog_authors")
    private List<Author> authors;
}}}
