#summary TOC for the Morphia documentation

= Introduction =
*Morphia* is a lightweight library for mapping Java objects to/from MongoDB (see http://mongodb.org). Morphia relies on annotations only, so there are no XML configuration files involved.

Morphia adds an abstraction layer on top of the Mongo Java driver, removing the error prone boiler plate code for mapping your plain old java object to/from the Mongo DBObject.

It works well with Guice and Spring, and provides (on top of MongoDB) an attractive persistence solution for users of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT).
