#summary Things you need to do before you can start using Morphia.

= Getting Started =

You will need Java SE 5 or higher. You will also need access to a Mongo database (http://mongodb.org). Please take a look at the rest of the [Dependencies].

This will consist of a few code snippets to get you going!

== First Entity ==
{{{
//@Entity here....
}}}
== Initialize Morphia/Mongo ==
{{{

Datastore ds = new Morphia().createDatastore("myDB"); //best to use (Mongo, String) method, where Mongo is a singleton.

...

//at application start
ds.ensureIndexes(); //creates indexes from @Index annotations in your entities
ds.ensureCaps(); //creates capped collections from @Entity
}}}

== Saving ==
{{{

MyEntity e = ...;

ds.save(e);
}}}

== Querying ==

{{{
MyEntity e = ds.find(MyEntity.class).get(); //get the first one by type
}}}

== Datastore ==
