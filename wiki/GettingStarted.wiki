#summary Things you need to do before you can start using Morphia.

= Getting Started =

As Morphia is annotation based, you will need Java SE 5 or higher. You will also need access to a Mongo database (http://mongodb.org).

To use Morphia in your project, you'll need the Morphia jar in your classpath. There are a few ways you can achieve this:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/morphia/downloads/list Download] it directly from (note that you will need to download the external [Dependencies] as well, namely the java mongodb driver.)

== Maven ==

  * If you use Maven2 to manage your project, you can reference Morphia as a dependency.
    * Repo: {{{http://morphia.googlecode.com/svn/mavenrepo/}}}
    * Project Settings: 
  {{{
  <dependency>
	<groupId>com.google.code</groupId>
	<artifactId>morphia</artifactId>
	<version>####</version>
  </dependency>
  }}}
    * Optional Jars (for certain features).
{{{
		<dependency>
			<groupId>cglib</groupId>
			<artifactId>cglib-nodep</artifactId>
			<version>[2.1_3,)</version>
			<type>jar</type>
			<optional>true</optional>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>com.thoughtworks.proxytoys</groupId>
		    <artifactId>proxytoys</artifactId>
		    <version>1.0</version>
			<type>jar</type>
			<optional>true</optional>
		</dependency>

}}}

== Source ==
 You can check out from subversion and build it yourself. You will need [http://maven.apache.org Maven2] for this. After you've [http://code.google.com/p/morphia/source/checkout checked out] the project, cd into the morphia folder, and run "mvn install" (note that you will need to have Mongo running on localhost for the tests to pass).
