= Building Concurrency Controls =

There are many ways to manage concurrency controls for mongodb. One way that [http://code.google.com/p/morphia Morphia] (a java-based type-safe mapper - ODM) does this is by supplying a special annotation, {{{@Version}}}, which is used to make sure that changes made by multiple clients don't step on each other.

{{{

class Person {
  @Id String name;
  String phone;

  @Version
  long v;
...
}

Datastore ds = ...;

Person me = new Person("Scott Hernandez");

ds.save(me) // all good
Person meAgain = ds.get(Person.class, "Scott Hernandez");

me.setPhone("111-376-7379"); 
ds.save(me); // now "me" and "meAgain" are different versions

try {
  ds.setPhone("123-376-7379");
  ds.save(meAgain);
} catch (ConcurrentModificationException e) {
  // ooppsss... someone modified it since we got it.
  // try again, but get the new version to work from... or notify the user.
}
