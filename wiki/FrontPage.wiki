*Morphia* is a lightweight type-safe library for [http://mongodb.org MongoDB].
 
 * Easy to use, and very lightweight; reflection is used once per type and cached.
 * Annotations describe mapping behavior; there are no XML files.
{{{
@Entity("employees")
class Employee {
  @Id String id; //auto-generated if not set
  String firstName, lastName; //Value types are automatically persisted
  Long salary = null; //Only non-null values are stored 

  @Embedded Address address;

  @Reference Employee manager; //refs are stored*, and loaded automatically

  @Reference List<Employee> underlings; //Interfaces are supported.
  @Property("started") Date startDate; //fields can be renamed
  @Property("left")Date endDate;

  @Indexed boolean active = false; //fields can be indexed for better performance
}

 * Provides Datastore and DAO<T,V> data access abstractions
 * Type-safe Query support
 * Works with Guice, Spring, and other DI frameworks.
 * GWT support (entities are just POJOs); GWT ignores annotations.
 * Includes a mapper that {{{void toObject(DBObject)}}} or {{{ DBObject fromObject(Object)}}}

*Note*: @Reference will not save the objects, just a reference to them. You must save them yourself.
