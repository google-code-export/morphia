*Morphia* is a lightweight type-safe library for mapping your Java objects to/from [http://mongodb.org MongoDB]:
<wiki:gadget url="http://www.ohloh.net/p/morphia/widgets/project_partner_badge.xml" height="55" border="0" />
 * Easy to use, and very lightweight; reflection is used once per type and cached.
 * [Datastore] and [DAOSupport DAO]<T,V> access abstractions, or roll your own...
 * Type-safe [Query] support
 * Annotations describe mapping behavior; there are no XML files.
{{{
@Entity("employees")
class Employee {
  @Id ObjectId id; // auto-generated, if not set (see ObjectId)
  String firstName, lastName; // value types are automatically persisted
  Long salary = null; // only non-null values are stored 

  @Embedded Address address;

  @Reference Employee manager; // refs are stored*, and loaded automatically
  @Reference List<Employee> underlings; // interfaces are supported

  @Serialized EncryptedReviews; // stored in one binary field 
 
  @Property("started") Date startDate; //fields can be renamed
  @Property("left")Date endDate;

  @Indexed boolean active = false; //fields can be indexed for better performance
  @NotSaved string readButNotStored; //fields can read, but not saved
  @Transient int notStored; //fields can be ignored (load/save)
  transient boolean stored = true; //not @Transient, will be ignored by Serialization/GWT for example.

  //Lifecycle methods -- Pre/PostLoad, Pre/PostSave...
  @PostLoad void postLoad(DBObject dbObj) { ... }
}
}}}
 * Works with Guice, Spring, and other DI frameworks.
 * Has many extension points to build on
 * Does not store Null/Empty values (by default).
 * GWT support (entities are just POJOs) --(GWT ignores annotations)
 * Advanced mapper that allows raw conversion, {{{void toObject(DBObject)}}} or {{{ DBObject fromObject(Object)}}}

*Note*: The documentation is being re-written; please be patient.

*Note*: @Reference will not save objects, just a reference to them; You must save them yourself.
