Below is a list of all the annotations and a brief descriptions of how to use them.

Note: In java the default attribute for an annotations can be used without a name. The name of the default attribute is always *value*. Any time you see {{{@MyAnnotation("arg")}}} it can be re-written as {{{@MyAnnotation(valeu = "arg")}}}, and must be if you add additional attributes.  
  
== Entity ==
Marks entities to be stored directly in a collection. Look [EntityAnnotation here] for more examples.

This annotations is optional in most cases. There is no harm in including it to be more verbose, and make clear the intention for the class.

=== Collection Name ==
Attribute name: *value*

{{{@Entity("name")}}}

=== Capped ===
Attribute name: *cap*

{{{@Entity(cap = @CappedAt(...))}}}

=== Do not store classname ===
Attribute name: *noClassnameStored*

{{{@Entity(noClassnameStored = true)}}}

This attribute is temporary until polymorphism is completed.

== Id ==
Marks a field in an {{{@Entity}}} to be the "_id" field in mongodb.

{{{
@Entity
class Myclass {
   @Id ObjectId id = new ObjectId();
   ...
}
}}}
== Transient ==
The field with not be persisted.

== Serialized ==
The field with be converted to binary, and persisted.

== {{{NotSaved}}} ==
The field will not be saved, but can be loaded. Good for data migration.

== {{{AlsoLoad}}} ==
The field will can be loaded as any of the supplied names. Good for data migration.

== Indexed ==
The field will be indexed. See [Datastore the datastore docs].

== Version ==
Marks a field in an {{{@Entity}}} to be control optimistic locking for that entity. It will be automatically managed for you. There is no need to set a value.

{{{
@Entity
class Myclass {
   ...
   @Version Long v;
}
}}}

== Reference ==
Marks fields to be stored in another collection and which are linked (by a stored reference). Look [ReferenceAnnotation here] for more examples.

== Embedded ==
Allows customization of certain options. Look [EmbeddedAnnotation here] for more examples.

== Lifecycle Annotations ==
See the this [LifecycleMethods page].
