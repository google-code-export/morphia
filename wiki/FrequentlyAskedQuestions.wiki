== Do you have to close connections? ==

Not really. The Mongo driver keeps a connection pool which is a field per Mongo instance. If you wish to release those resources, just make sure you stop using the Mongo instance.
 
== Huh, why is there a className field in my Document?  Can I remove it? ==

Yes, you can; look [here EntityAnnotation#Class_name_in_document_and_how_to_suppress_it]
